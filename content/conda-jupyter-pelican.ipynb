    "Using Conda environments is a great way to create reproducible, cross-platform data products.  I used virtual environments a bit before reading Jake VanderPlas' [great article](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/) on conda and now I've completely made the switch.  Maintaining separate interpreters for projects is nice and so is avoiding compiling issues on Windows, however the best reason to use conda is the `environment.yml` file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Building a conda environment from a file is very similiar to using a Makefile - it will reliably recreate a Python interpreter with specific libraries installed.  This isn't useful at the start of a project but after wrangling data and installing libraries of various utility you will ideally end up with a product to share.  This is real power of the conda environment file: the ability to export the state of the conda environment including dependencies to a file and commit that file to the project repository.  Now you can deploy code, model outputs and the execution environment to a server, share it with a friend or redo your own work two years from now on a new machine with no fuss!\n",

    "The magic is as simple as:  \n",
    "`$ conda env export > environment.yml`  \n",

    "What is truely next-level about conda is the ablity to install non-Python tools with conda.  From wrapping some [MATLAB](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/octave), calling [ggplot](https://anaconda.org/r/r-ggplot2) or just curious about [Julia](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/julia) you can reproducible include that in your project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is flexible tool to explore and present results and needs very little introduction these days since even [Nature is writing about it](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1).  One of its less discussed features is relevant to conda, namely Jupyter's ability to use [multiple kernals](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).  So after installing R via conda, you can run R scripts (or Julia or MATLAB or Perl etc).  \n",
