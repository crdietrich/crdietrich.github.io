    "Using Conda is a great way to create reproducible, cross-platform data products.  I used virtual environments before reading Jake VanderPlas' [article](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/) on conda and now I've completely made the switch.  Maintaining separate interpreters for projects is nice and so is avoiding compiling issues on Windows, however the best reason to use conda is the `environment.yml` file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Building a conda environment from a file is very similiar to using a Makefile - it will reliably recreate a Python interpreter with specific libraries installed.  This isn't useful at the start of a project but after wrangling data and installing libraries of various utility you will ideally end up with a product to share.  This is real power of the conda environment file: the ability to export the state of the environment including dependencies to a file and commit it to the project repository.  Now you can deploy code, model outputs and the execution environment to a server, share it with a friend or redo your own work two years from now on a new machine with no fuss!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is as simple as:  \n",
    "`$ conda env export > environment.yml`  \n",

    "  \n",
    "What is next-level about conda is the ablity to install non-Python tools with conda.  From wrapping [MATLAB](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/octave), calling [ggplot](https://anaconda.org/r/r-ggplot2) or just taking [Julia](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/julia) for a spin you can reproducibly include these in your project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a tool that needs little introduction [these days](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1).  One of its less discussed features the ability to use [multiple kernals](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyteenvironmentsr-kernels).  So after installing a language kernal via conda, you can run R scripts or Julia or MATLAB or Perl etc right in the notebook.  \n",

I initally followed Vik Paruchuri''s post [Building a Data Science Portfolio: Setting Up a Blog](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-setup-a-data-science-blog/) which lays out the pelican static site process and discusses some trade offs."
